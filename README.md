#DEVELOPERS NOTES  
  
Most of the items in the todo list is waiting on the engine used to develop the game to release new updates allowing support for the features above.  
This project is just something I am doing for fun on my free time and may never see the light of day in the ANDROID PLAY STORE , AMAZON APP STORE, WINDOWS APP STORE, or the ITUNES STORE as the cost of these stores are not in my finances as I cannot afford the yearly fees.
